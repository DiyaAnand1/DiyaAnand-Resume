        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Assistant Research CoordinatorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>Diya Anand is currently a student at the University of California, Riverside. As a fourth-year Psychology major, she spends a lot of her time engaging in research. Over the course of her college career, she has worked as a research assistant at the UC Riverside Brain Game Center, presented two different posters the Undergraduate Research Symposium, will be presenting at the R'PSYC research symposium, conducted her own research on the Effects of Task Environment on Young Healthy Individuals with Simulated Central Vision Loss and in the future hopes to publish a paper on her findings in the UCR Undergraduate Research Journal. She currently works at the UCR Brain Game Center as an Assistant Research Coordinator. Her job consists of taking the lead in research studies, training research assistants, creating descriptive protocols, and scheduling participants. After graduation, she plans to continue working at the Brain Game Center, and eventually move on to graduate school.<br>

        Diya has a lot of experience working with children. When she was younger, she worked as a karate instructor for children as young as 5 and as old as 12. In classes, she often catered her teaching based on a student's particular learning style. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she worked as an in-person tutor for students struggling with the shift to online classes and worked with a kindergarten student and a first-grade student. Her experience with students has led to a career choice of Educational Psychology. She hopes to work with students with disabilities in grade school who require individualized education plans and require psychological testing. <br><br>

            In her free time she takes part in many different extracurricular activities. As a third degree black belt, she often used to spend her free time on the mats at her karate school. After moving cities, she is interested in taking up Jiu-Jitsu and boxing as some alternative martial arts options, as well as possibly continuing her karate education somewhere local. An avid soccer player, Diya spent most of her childhood playing competitive soccer. She has traveled all over California for tournaments and games, and continues to enjoy soccer in a local Riverside adults soccer club. Although she no longer plays competitively she enjoys playing with her friends. After the pandemic, she discovered her love for weight lifting and body building, and although she does not have any plans to compete she hits the gym every morning without fail, and starts her day with lifting. In her free time she also plays video games with her friends. Feel free to ask her about her Elden Ring builds, but be aware that once she starts talking about it she won't stop! Although being a busy student means it is hard to find time for herself, she enjoys reading web-novels. The genre of high fantasy was introduced to her by her brother when she was very young, and now she finds her self gravitating to all types of high fantasy; books, games, comics and more. Baking has also made it's way into her life recently, and she is now and avid baker and cook.
